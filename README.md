# LearN!
### About
This is a learning resource that provides access to video lessons about programming and relevant tools and technologies in the front-end world. Please note that not all the pages are implemented. Although those that are implemented provide sufficient information on the product. 

Flow is depicted on the following diagram **sitemap.png**

#### Implemented pages
- Landing page (**index.html**)
- Catalog page (**catalog.html**)
- A lesson page specific to a lesson (**lesson.html**)
- Contact page (**contact_us.html**)
- Login Page (**Login.html**)

Source code could be found in the `src` directory in the root of the prject.
Built and ready to run UI is in the `dist` directory.

### Tech stack
- Node.js v8.9.1
- Gulp 3.9.1 (task runner)
- gulp-atomizer 3.0.7

### Atomic CSS
I've chose to use Atomic CSS approach, thus had to set up Node.js environment to compile HTML class definitions int `atomic.css` (under `dist` directory)
More on the atomic styling approach https://acss.io

### Demo
You can see how pages look like either by running `*.html` files from the `dist` directory or viewing screenshots under `screenshots` folder.
